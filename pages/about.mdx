# About

**Strata** refers to a system of property ownership where a building or complex is divided into individual units or lots, with shared ownership of common areas. This type of property ownership is common in apartment buildings, townhouses, and mixed-use developments. Each owner has exclusive ownership of their unit (lot) and shared ownership of the common areas (e.g., hallways, elevators, gardens, and other communal spaces). Strata properties are typically managed by a Strata Committee or Owners Corporation
